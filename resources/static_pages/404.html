    <h1>Oops.</h1>

    <p>
        The service you're looking for doesn't exist.  Please check to make sure the following are all true, as
        they're what drive the ability of nginx-proxy to forward requests.

        <ul>
            <li>The container is running</li>
            <li>The VIRTUAL_HOST and VIRTUAL_PORT are set correctly.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    
    <p>
        If it's running, give it a few seconds.  Sometimes it can take nginx proxy up to 30 seconds to refresh
        it's configuration.
